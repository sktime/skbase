``skbase`` was started in May 2022 by Franz Király and Ryan Kuhns
in order to make it easier for others to use `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_
design principles in a range of projects.

The project builds on and was heavily inspired by
`scikti-learn's <scikit-learn-about>`_ `BaseEstimator API <scikit-learn-est>`_.
`sktime`_ built on this by developing a ``BaseObject`` that built on these
design principles and added an `sktime`_ interface for
general parametric objects. The ``skbase`` project is focused on continuing
to build on these efforts, while further genericizing the design concept to
a variety of use-cases.

Development is supported by the original project
members, new core developers and the broader community (see
`contributors <contributors.md>`_).
