Roadmap

Welcome to ``skbase``'s roadmap.

.. note::

    The project is under active planning and development. We will continue to update
    our roadmap as the project matures and we plan future work.

Project Goals
=============

``skbase`` aims to provide easy-to-use tools for working with and
developing new packages that use `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_ style
parametric objects.

To accomplish this we plan to:

- Add additional unit tests
- Refactor existing package functionality to minimize dependencies
- Finalizing and implementing an API for ``BaseObject``-s
- Expanding the user guide documentation that explains ``skbase``'s core concepts
- Provide tutorials on using ``skbase`` in your own projects

We are also considering creating:

- A template repository that developers can use to easily create their own
  package based on ``skbase``'s design and also test the ``skbase``
  package's testing interface.
