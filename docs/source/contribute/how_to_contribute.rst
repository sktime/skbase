How to contribute
=================

You can contribute to ``skbase`` in a variety of ways. This includes
contributing code (see our :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>` for information our planned
development), but we value all kinds of contributions. Helping improve
the package's documentation or providing feedback and weighing in on existing
issues on `github <https://github.com/sktime/BaseObject/issues>`_ are
especially welcome.

The ``skbase`` team is also happy to support new contributors and
individuals looking to develop their skills.

If you want to get started contributing, we recommend:

- Say hello on `Slack`_
- Use our :ref:`developer guide <dev_guide>` to setup a contributing environment
- Pick a good first `issue <https://github.com/sktime/BaseObject/issues>`_
  to work on that will let you get familiar with our contributing process

Once your first Pull Request is merged you may decide to continue contributing
regularly. Talk with the development team on `Slack`_ about your interests and
how you can best contribute to the project.
